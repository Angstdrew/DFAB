                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>The Fablab in SP has a large number of tools, equipment and machinery which we can use to fabricate
                    our
                    projects with. As part of the module, we would need to use the aforementioned machinery and thus
                    we will need to learn how to operate the different machinery, tools and equipment safely
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>

                            <h4>My hand sketch protoype for a phone stand.</h4>
                            <br> the main idea behind this is that the phone stand is only 1 layer of cardboard made up
                            of 3 pieces of cardboard that
                            can be folded up to support the phone and can also be folded back so as to be more
                            compactable.
                            <br> <br> Below you can see my first prototype of my phone stand

                                </n4>My first protoype for the phone stand.</h4>
                            <br> From this prototype, I learnt alot about what I have to change in my design. <br>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The cardboard that I used was too flimsy, to support my phone properly I would have
                                    to use a
                                    sturdier cardboard
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The dimentions that I had in mind were too small, even with sturdier cardbord, These
                                    dimentions would not be enough
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The phone would slide right off, i would need some sort of tab to keep the phone in
                                    place
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Lastly, The wedges in the cardboard were in the wrong direction. They were
                                    horizontal but they should be vertical
                                    so as to keep as sturdy as possible
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            </p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <hr>
                <table>
                    <tr>

                        <td>
                            <p>
                            <h4>My final protoype for the phone stand</h4>
                            <br> It's really sturdy and looks great on my table!
                            <br> I used a sturdier cardboard from a vitamin drink box and aligned the wedges perfectly!
