                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>The reason why I wanted to choose this elective is mainly because I wanted to make funny gadgets
                    and robots such as what micheal reeves makes on his youtube channel link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelReeves">here</a>
                    I find his content really funny and am heavily inspired to make products similar to what he makes
                    <br> Many ideas came to my mind and I shortlisted a few of them
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Fortnite sound board
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lamp that lights up only when you screem
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A gaming mouse that stops working when you die in a game
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>Out of all these ideas, I chose the lamp that lights up only when you scream as it not as difficult as a sounboard but not as easy 
                    as just writing a program that stops your mouse from working
                </p>
