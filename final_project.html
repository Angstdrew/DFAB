                <h2>Final Project CA2 (Mood "Mood" lamp)</h2>
                <p>These days there are many mood lamps on the market but what I'm trying to make is the one and only
                    true "mood" Lamp
                    that will be able to properly display the mood it detects!
                </p>
                <h3>Disclaimer!!</h3>
                <p>This product is only in the prototype stage and is currently only able to display negative moods,
                    watch it light up your living room with
                    aesthetic red lights as your parents argue over their failing marriage.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/sketchfp.jpeg" width="400px" padding=10px border=1>
                </div>

                <p style="width: 400px;"> As you can see my project mainly consists of 2 components which are the box
                    and the acrylic piece
                    that is to be engraved with BIG CHUNGUS and then slotted into
                    the box, I will laser cut the box and the acrylic piece and 3d print the the triangle clips to hold
                    the acrylic piece in place.
                </p>
                <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p style="width: 400px;">The main concept behind this project is to make the led lights light up when
                    sound is detected from the microphone.
                    The led's are placed directly below the laser-cutted chungus. since the acrylic is transparent,
                    light from the led is able to pass into the
                    acrylic, the chungus that is engraved on the acrylic is engraved halfway, this so that when the
                    light hits any line on the chungus, it is able
                    to display this meme in all its grandeur.
                </p>
                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p style="width: 400px;">I took inspiration from the <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqAUmgE3WyM">Useless box kit</a>
                    I decided to create a "useless" sort of lamp where you have to shout for the lamp to light up, It
                    also is the world's very first mood "mood" lamp as it acurrately displays your mood (which has to be
                    either angry/frustrated). It is best used when you are extremely stressed for an exam and you want
                    to release anger but still need light to study!</p>
                <h2>3d model of the box</h2>
                <iframe
                    src="https://ichat1738.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd96863f4f7e091710586?mode=embed"
                    width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"
                    mozallowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                <p style="width: 400px;">This is the 3d model of the support box, I will place the necessary electronics
                    in here such as
                    the arduino board, the breadboard, and the sound sensor and Led strip in the box, The 2 traingles
                    clips located at the top will be
                    3d printed
                </p>
                <h2>Acrylic piece</h2>
                <img src="images/acrylic.jpg" width="400px" padding=10px border=1>
                <p style="width: 400px;">I traced over a image of big chungus and added his glorious being onto my
                    humble draft in
                    adobe iilustrator with the proper measurements for the base. I then imported the vector diagram as a
                    dxf file which I used
                    to 3d print with
                </p>
                <h2>Electronics</h2>
                <img src="images/elec.jpeg" width="400px" padding=10px border=1>
                <p style="width: 400px;">Electronics wise, I used a sound sensor, an arduino nano board, a mini
                    breadboard, and a
                    adafruit neopixel led strip with 6 led, all the components are linked together properly except the
                    led strip, this is because the
                    led stip that I use in the picture is faulty as I tried to solder on stronger wires. The original
                    wires were rather weak and
                    fell off pretty quickly. I felt that maybe I accidently melted some of the plastic during soldering,
                    hence rendering this
                    led strip useless.</p>
                <h2>Code for the electronics</h2>
                <img src="images/code.jpg" width="600px" padding=10px border=1>
                <p style="width: 400px;">The code displayed above is are the codes that I used for my arduino. For this
                    code, I imported the adafruit neopixel library to control the led strip used in my project. I
                    created an
                    if else statement showing that if the sound sensor was to pick up any sound, it would shine red and
                    when it dosnt
                    pick up any sounds, it would turn off the led pixels
                </p>
                <h2>3d printed parts</h2>
                <img src="images/3d.jpeg" width="600px" padding=10px border=1>
                <p style="width: 400px;">These are the parts that I 3d printed. These are clips that have protruding
                    edges that are inserted into
                    the top of my box to hole to middle acrylic piece in place </p>
                <h2>How-To</h2>
                <img src="images/setup.jpeg" width="600px" padding=10px border=1>
                <p style="width: 400px;">Simply just download the folders from fusion 360 and create place the sides of
                    the box in a dxf file. Do the same for the image on the acrylic through adobe illustrator then
                    export the files as dxf, laser cut the components on 3 millimetre thick acrylicand glue the boxes
                    together. place the electronics as shown above and add the code shown above as well. Finally 3d
                    print the triangle clips before
                    glueing them down as well. Follow these steps and anyone should be able to make their very own mood
                    "mood" lamp.</p>
                <h2>What was completed, what was successful, what needs to be done further</h2>
                <p style="width: 400px;">The project was overall rather successful and all the parts fit properly and
                    the code was well written. I managed to successfully code the sound sensor and led strip while
                    learning a lot in the process.<br> What can be improved is that I could add another clip at the bottom
                    of the box along with the led strip so as to further balance the acrylic piece onto the led strip
                    and direct the light better into the acrylic piece as well, the led strip isnt working as of yet due
                    to soldering issues but aside from that, the product works!<br> What needs to be done further is to
                    maybe change colour for different loudness of the sound, for example it could be yellow or pink when
                    the user isnt screaming at the mood lamp and when they are it would light red.</p>
